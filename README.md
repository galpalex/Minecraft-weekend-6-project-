Understanding the task
Minecraft is a sandbox video game originally created by
Swedish programmer, Markus "Notch" Persson .
The creative and building aspects of Minecraf t enable
players to build constructions out of textured cubes in a 3D
procedurally generated world.
In our version of the game, we will use a 2D pre-generated
world (meaning, our world will be hardcoded).

1. The user will have 3 types of tools:
   a. Axe - for cutting trees
   b. Pickaxe - for mining rocks
   c. Shovel - for digging dirt
2. Clicking on a tool followed by clicking on a tile in the
   world will remove the tile. (If it is of the correct type
   according to #1) and add it to the inventory.
3. User can click on the tile in the inventory and place it
   back in the world (just the last one).
   Approaching the assignment
4. Sit down and think about the implementation
   a. Different functionalities
   b. Things that should be in HTML
   c. Things that should be generated on the fly using JS
   d. Write a lot of pseudo code before typing one
   bit of code!
5. Start small, one tool and one texture type
6. Try to make it as close to a complete product as you can.
   Implementation constraints
7. Use a matrix to represent the world and generate the
   world according to that matrix.
8. Do not use 3D party plugins
9. Try to write everything from scratch, if you copy code
   from the internet be sure that you understand it
   completely.
   Basic Requirements
10. You should implement all of the features seen in the
    following video
11. You must use Git throughout the assignment (and not
    only commit at the end)
12. The UI/UX should look at least as good as the demo.
13. You should create a landing page with a tutorial
    explaining the game.
14. A reset button that will reset the world it its initial state.
    Tips
15. Prefer using CSS classes instead of dynamically changing
    CSS properties in JS.
16. The background-image property would be a better
    choice than <img> for tiles.
17. Create an object that holds all the logic.
18. Break down the main functionalities in different
    functions.
19. Hardcode the containers in HTML.
20. Separate your concerns. A separate HTML file, CSS file
    and JS file.
    Geek out
    Extra Features:
    • Add the ability to remember more than the last tile
    clicked (maintain the user’s inventory)
    • Add more tools
    • Add more tiles
    • Make it responsive
    • Allow the user to set the world width and height
    • Add themes (changing a theme should change the
    world’s textures)
    • Add more than one world type
    • Make the world wider than the screen and allow
    scrolling
    • Add fade-in/out effect when adding/removing tiles
    Unleash the ninja within
    • Randomize the generation of the world (make it
    reasonable, trees should be on grass, nothing floating
    in the air, etc).
